# odin-recipes

In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website using all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. Once I have completed it, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

- creating and naming directories and html files.
- adding headings, links, images, paragraphs, and ordered and unordered lists to the body.
- using the external CSS method. 
- using properties such as color, background color, typography basics, text align, and image height and width.
